IntakeCTF was the WMG Cyber Society's first CTF that we have hosted. The CTF had over 90 challenges created by 6 members of the society, with over 100 participants submitting a total of 731 flags. The challenges ranged in difficulty, from easy XOR bruteforcing to reversing a VM that uses segfaults to determine instructions.
