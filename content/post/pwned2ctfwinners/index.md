[pwnEd 2](https://pwned.sigint.mx/) was a 32 hour CTF, hosted by [Edinburgh University](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) students. One of the society's teams, **De Moivres Like Jagger**, came in first place, beating over 20 teams in the competition. 

A number of our members were also the first to complete many of the challenges hosted within the CTF. We're also hosting some of our member's writeups which can be found below.
